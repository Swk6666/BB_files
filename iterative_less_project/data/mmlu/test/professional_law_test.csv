"One afternoon, a pilot was flying a small airplane when it suddenly ran out of gas. As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father.

The leader of the foreign country sought the assistance of the United States in providing emergency aid. The President initially wanted to send troops from a west coast military base but learned that they were out on training maneuvers. As a result, the President issued an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the supervision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to travel to the foreign country to engage in emergency rescue operations. This federal agency's main function is to patrol the borders to prevent illegal aliens from entering the United States.

"For many years, persons engaged in real estate transactions in a state have utilized installment land contracts. The so-called installment land contract has been popular as a substitute for the mortgage or deed of trust. Under such a contract, the seller agrees to accept, and the buyer agrees to pay, the purchase price in installments over a stipulated period of time. The vendor retains legal title as security for the payment of the purchase price; and the vendee has equitable title under the doctrine of equitable conversion. The most important characteristic of the installment land contract, however, is the forfeiture clause, which provides that if the vendee is in default for 30 days, the vendor may, at his option, declare a forfeiture of the contract, in which case all payments made shall be forfeited as ""liquidated"" damages and the buyer shall become a tenant at will of the seller. Over the years, many sellers of property under such installment land contracts have declared forfeitures in situations where the prospective buyers were delinquent in their payments, even when the buyer was late with a single payment after nearly all the other payments had been made. In order to remedy this inequitable situation, the state legislature enacted a statute requiring any seller attempting to declare a forfeiture of an installment land contract to do so by instituting a formal foreclosure action in the courts. The new law also provided that prior to the commencement of such a foreclosure action, the seller under such an arrangement must give the buyer a 60-day grace period to make up any delinquent installment payment with interest. The new law expressly applied both to installment land contracts entered into subsequent to its enactment and to installment land contracts already in existence at the time of its enactment. Is this new state statute likely to be held constitutional?","Yes, because it is a reasonable regulation of the procedure to be followed in such cases and does not substantially diminish the underlying obligations of the buyer.","Yes, because the authority to enact laws regulating real estate sales transactions occurring within the boundaries of individual states is reserved exclusively to the states by the Tenth Amendment.","No, because application of the law to installment land contracts entered into prior to its enactment is a violation of the obligation of contracts.","No, because application of the law to installment land contracts entered into before or after its enactment is a deprivation of a proprietary interest without due process of the law.",A

When the dentist took possession of the building, he did not obtain any fire insurance. The landlord learned that the building was not insured at the time of the fire as per the original agreement. In an action by the landlord against the tenant to recover for the fire loss, the landlord will most probably","recover, because in accordance with the Rule in Spencer's Case, the covenant to maintain fire insurance would ""touch and concern"" the land.","recover, because the tenant's obligation to maintain fire insurance did not terminate after his assignment to the doctor.","not recover, because the covenant to provide fire insurance did not run with the land.","not recover, because the dentist, as assignee, would be liable for the fire loss.",B
"A nightclub owner applied for a required zoning permit to open a nude-dancing nightclub in the theater district of a city. An organization of influential city residents began an intensive lobbying effort to persuade the city council to deny the owner a permit to operate any type of nude- dancing facility at any time or in any place in the city. The owner has sued the city in an appropriate federal court, seeking an injunction that would prohibit the city council from considering the organization's views, on the ground that if the organization is successful in its lobbying efforts, the owner's First and Fourteenth Amendment rights would be violated. The city has moved to dismiss the action. Should the court dismiss the owner's action?","No, because nude dancing is symbolic speech and is therefore protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.","No, because the organization does not seek a reasonable time, place, and manner regulation of nude dancing, but instead seeks a total ban on the owner's opening any type of nude-dancing facility at any time or in any place in the city.","Yes, because the action is not ripe.","Yes, because the First and Fourteenth Amendments do not protect obscenity, and nude dancing is obscene.",C

"A man and a school entered into a written contract providing that the man would be employed for one year in various capacities (athletic director, teacher, football coach) in return for an annual salary of $37,750. Shortly thereafter and prior to the July commencement date of employment, the school elected to terminate its varsity football program. The school publicly attributed the decision to economic factors. Upon hearing this news, the man sought out the headmaster of the school to inquire as to the effect, if any, of this decision on his salary and responsibilities. In order to resolve the matter, the headmaster arranged a meeting among various school officials to discuss the man's situation. Afterward, the school sent written notice to the man of its intent to terminate his employment contract. The man then commenced suit to recover the full balance of his salary calculated on the basis of the contract. At trial, the headmaster was called to testify. On direct examination, he testified that six people (including himself) attended the meeting where it was decided to terminate the man's employment contract. When asked to identify the attendees, the headmaster gave the names of four but, despite trying, was unable to remember the name of the fifth person. The attorney who called the headmaster to testify now seeks to show him her handwritten notes that the attorney prepared during her pretrial interview with the headmaster, in which he provided all five names. The trial court is likely to consider the showing of the notes taken as",a proper attempt to refresh the headmaster's recollection.,a proper attempt to introduce recorded recollection.,an improper attempt to support the headmaster's credibility.,an improper attempt to lead the witness.,A
"A baseball fan purchased two tickets for a World Series baseball game. The fan contacted his best friend and invited him to go to the game. The friend, who was a fanatic baseball fan, eagerly agreed. The fan told the friend that the game started at 7:00 p. m. and that he would pick him up at about 5:00 p. m. so they could get there early to watch batting practice. They were driving to the game together when the fan sped up to cross an intersection while the traffic signal was changing from amber to red. As he reached the intersection, the fan was traveling at 50 m. p. h. although the posted speed limit was 25 m. p. h. Simultaneously, a car entered the intersection on red and collided with the fan's vehicle. The friend suffered a broken pelvis in the collision.

"Denise Developer found a near-perfect piece of property zoned commercial in the downtown area of Pleasantville. She hired an architect to design a high tech office building with an objective of attracting upscale tech-industry tenants. She approached Microhard and secured a lease agreement for over half of the available square footage. The lease was not recorded, but the agreement allowed Denise to attract other wealthy tenants. She also disclosed the Microhard lease on her application for a $1,500,000 construction loan from Maximum Mortgage Company. Denise executed a mortgage and related promissory note in favor of Maximum. Maximum recorded the mortgage immediately. The office building was completed and Denise had more tenant demand than available space, so the building opened full. One year later, Denise ran into financial trouble and defaulted on the mortgage. Maximum took possession and immediately notified all the tenants that their leases were cancelled, that they were evicted, and that they must vacate immediately unless they were willing to sign a new lease at double the previous rent. The recording statute in the jurisdiction specified ""every conveyance, encumbrance, or lease not recorded is void as against any subsequent party recording first."" The tenants retained you to compel Maximum to honor the leases at the lower rents.

"A landlord leased an apartment to a tenant on a month-to-month basis beginning on the first of the month, with rent payable monthly. Five months into the lease, the tenant failed to pay rent. The landlord then sued the tenant for possession for nonpayment of rent. The tenant successfully defended this suit on the ground that the apartment was uninhabitable and that, accordingly, no rent was properly payable. On May 7, immediately following the court order in the tenant's favor, the landlord served the tenant with a written but not notarized notice to terminate the tenancy and to vacate the apartment on or before June 30. On July 1, the tenant was still in possession, nothing had changed, and the landlord brought an appropriate action for possession. The tenant prevailed.

"In an action for malpractice, a plaintiff sued a doctor, claiming that the latter failed to properly diagnose his emphysema condition. The plaintiff contends that he went to the doctor for a medical examination after experiencing chest pains and shortness of breath. However, the doctor found no evidence of the disease and advised him that he was probably suffering from indigestion. Thereafter, the plaintiff was examined by another doctor who discovered that the plaintiff in fact was suffering from a chronic case of emphysema. At trial, the plaintiff calls the other doctor as his first witness. The other doctor proposes to testify the x-rays of the plaintiff's lungs showed that his respiratory organs were marked by distension, which was characteristic of emphysema.
