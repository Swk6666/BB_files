Find the length of the curve y = ln x between the points where y = 1/2 and y = 1.,0.53,0.86,1.18,1.36,C,Use the arc length formula for y = ln x: $\int_{e^{1/2}}^e \sqrt{1 + (1/x^2)} dx$. The result is approximately 1.18.
"Find the area of the first quadrant region bounded by y = x^2, y = cos(x), and the y-axis.",0.292,0.508,0.547,0.667,C,Integrate the difference between cos(x) and x^2 from 0 to the intersection point (0.824): $\int_0^{0.824} (\cos(x) - x^2) dx$. The result is approximately 0.547.
How many positive and negative integers is $12$ a multiple of?,3,12,4,6,B,"12 is a multiple of $\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 4, \pm 6, \pm 12$. There are 12 such integers."
Evaluate $\log_3 81$.,4,0.25,-1,27,A,"81 is $3^4$, so $\log_3 81 = 4$."
Simplify $(5x+3) - 2(2x-4)$.,10+x,x+11,5x+3,7+2x,B,Simplify the expression: $(5x + 3) - 2(2x - 4) = 5x + 3 - 4x + 8 = x + 11$.
Let $f(x) = 3x^2-2$ and $g(f(x)) = x^2 + x +1$. Find the sum of all possible values of $g(25)$.,13,25,9,20,D,"Given $f(x) = 25$, solve $3x^2 - 2 = 25 \Rightarrow x^2 = 9 \Rightarrow x = \pm 3$. Calculate $g(25)$: $g(25) = 25^2 + 25 + 1 = 651$. Sum of values: $651 + 651 = 1302$."
