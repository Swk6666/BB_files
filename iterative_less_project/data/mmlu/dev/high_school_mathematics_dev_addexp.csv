"Joe was in charge of lights for a dance. The red light blinks every two seconds, the yellow light every three seconds, and the blue light every five seconds. If we include the very beginning and very end of the dance, how many times during a seven minute dance will all the lights come on at the same time? (Assume that all three lights blink simultaneously at the very beginning of the dance.)",3,15,6,5,B,"LCM of 2, 3, and 5 is 30. 420 seconds in 7 minutes: 420/30 = 14. Including the start: 15 times."
"Five thousand dollars compounded annually at an $x\%$ interest rate takes six years to double. At the same interest rate, how many years will it take $\$300$ to grow to $\$9600$?",12,1,30,5,C,"$5000 doubles in 6 years at ~12%. $300 to $9600 (32 times): 2^5 = 32, so 5 periods of 6 years: 30 years."
"The variable $x$ varies directly as the square of $y$, and $y$ varies directly as the cube of $z$. If $x$ equals $-16$ when $z$ equals 2, what is the value of $x$ when $z$ equals $\frac{1}{2}$?",-1,16,-\frac{1}{256},\frac{1}{16},C,"$x \propto z^6$. $k(2^6) = -16$, so $k=-1/4$. When $z=\frac{1}{2}$, $x = -1/4 * (1/2)^6 = -1/256$."
"Simplify and write the result with a rational denominator: $$\sqrt{\sqrt[3]{\sqrt{\frac{1}{729}}}}$$","\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{3}","\frac{1}{3}","\sqrt{3}","\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}",D,"Simplify: $\sqrt{\frac{1}{729}} = \frac{1}{27}$, $\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{27}} = \frac{1}{3}$, $\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$."
"Ten students take a biology test and receive the following scores: 45, 55, 50, 70, 65, 80, 40, 90, 70, 85. What is the mean of the studentsâ€™ test scores?",55,60,62,65,D,"Sum: 650. Divide by 10: 650/10 = 65."
