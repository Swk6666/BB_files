"Joe was in charge of lights for a dance. The red light blinks every two seconds, the yellow light every three seconds, and the blue light every five seconds. If we include the very beginning and very end of the dance, how many times during a seven minute dance will all the lights come on at the same time? (Assume that all three lights blink simultaneously at the very beginning of the dance.)",3,15,6,5,B,"To find when all lights blink together, we need the least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 3, and 5. The LCM of 2, 3, and 5 is 30 seconds. There are 420 seconds in 7 minutes. Dividing 420 by 30 gives 14, so they blink together 14 times during the dance. Including the start, it's 15 times."
"Five thousand dollars compounded annually at an $x\%$ interest rate takes six years to double. At the same interest rate, how many years will it take $\$300$ to grow to $\$9600$?",12,1,30,5,C,"To solve this, use the compound interest formula and the rule of 72 for approximation. If $5000 doubles in 6 years, the annual interest rate is about 12% (72/6). To find how long it takes $300 to grow to $9600, calculate $300 * 2^n = $9600. Since $9600/$300 = 32, which is $2^5$, it takes 30 years."
"The variable $x$ varies directly as the square of $y$, and $y$ varies directly as the cube of $z$. If $x$ equals $-16$ when $z$ equals 2, what is the value of $x$ when $z$ equals $\frac{1}{2}$?",-1,16,-\frac{1}{256},\frac{1}{16},C,"Given the relationships $x \propto y^2$ and $y \propto z^3$, combine them: $x \propto (z^3)^2 = z^6$. When $z=2$, $x=-16$, so $k(2^6) = -16$, giving $k=-1/4$. When $z=1/2$, $x = -1/4 * (1/2)^6 = -1/256$."
"Simplify and write the result with a rational denominator: $$\sqrt{\sqrt[3]{\sqrt{\frac{1}{729}}}}$$","\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{3}","\frac{1}{3}","\sqrt{3}","\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}",D,"Simplify inside out: $\sqrt{\frac{1}{729}} = \frac{1}{27}$, $\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{27}} = \frac{1}{3}$, $\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$."
"Ten students take a biology test and receive the following scores: 45, 55, 50, 70, 65, 80, 40, 90, 70, 85. What is the mean of the studentsâ€™ test scores?",55,60,62,65,D,"Sum the scores: 45 + 55 + 50 + 70 + 65 + 80 + 40 + 90 + 70 + 85 = 650. Divide by the number of students: 650/10 = 65."
